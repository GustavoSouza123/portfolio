    "about": "<p>My name is Gustavo. I'm a systems development student from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I had my first contact with programming at the age of 13 through videos and tutorials, and since my first programming logic course, I knew that I wanted to continue learning more and more about computers.</p><p>Since then, my interest in technology only increases. I constantly seek to expand my knowledge about programming, which is why I develop personal projects and write on my blog about the technologies I study.</p><p>In addition to computers, I also really enjoy learning languages. For the last 3 years, I have been studying English and German, and I have no intention of stopping studying languages.</p>",
